 # Introduction

 It is no secret that **COVID-19** and the ensuing lockdowns caused by its spread has dealt devastating amounts of damage to families, communities, economies, and societies. Fortunately, humanity’s brightest minds have managed to develop what is probably one of mankind’s greatest inventions — the **Vaccine** — to provide a path out and into recovery.

 13 vaccines proven to work against COVID-19 have each been approved by at least 1 country, and are currently being used in over 160 countries to blunt the effects of COVID-19, and to develop a way to reopen society safely. However, even as we have the means to end 1 pandemic, another, potentially more destructive one, is spreading like wildfire: **Vaccine Denialism and Misinformation.**

 Across multiple countries, multiple groups have stated that they will reject any COVID-19 vaccine, despite it being available and safe for them. They believe in conspiracy theories about the vaccines, like it implants a microchip *(it won’t)*, or that everyone who takes it will die *(incredibly, incredibly unlikely)*, or that certain brands are just water being injected into your arm *(they aren’t)*. Their decision could prove fatal, not just for themselves, but for the people they care about, and others within society. Fortunately, technology can show how deadly this could be, before it can affect countless lives.
