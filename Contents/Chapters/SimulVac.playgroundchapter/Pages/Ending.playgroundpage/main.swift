 # To Conclude
 See how different the scenarios are? With everyone getting the vaccine, less people get severely sick, meaning that we don’t have to keep on overloading our hospitals — and meaning people could have themselves treated before their condition, COVID-19 or not, gets worse. With everyone getting the vaccine, less people have to die, meaning that families won’t be torn apart by a virus we already have the solution for.

 Let’s help each other get rid of COVID-19. Let’s help each other see our loved ones, friends, colleagues, and others. Let’s help each other get back to normal, and to build back even stronger and better than before.

 Mask up. Get the Shot. **Save lives.**
