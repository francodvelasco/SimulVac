 # How about only those willing?
 This time, let’s take a look at what could actually happen in a country: here in the Philippines, a [recent survey suggested 61% of Filipinos would refuse to take the COVID-19 vaccine, while only 16% mentioned that they were willing to get the shot](https://www.rappler.com/nation/filipinos-vaccination-against-coronavirus-pulse-asia-survey-march-2021); 23% did not give a response.

 Medical experts have said that [60-70% of the population should be vaccinated to reach the point of herd immunity](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/health/herd-immunity-covid-coronavirus.html), or the point when enough people would have been protected against COVID-19 that its effects to the individual and society are minimized, allowing society to reopen safely. The percentage suggested by the poll is incredibly far from that, and could lead to *devastating* effects on people, our health systems, and society — effects that could have been prevented by the vaccine. Run the code, and see how that would play out.

 More information about the simulation can be found in the i icon in the view.

 Once you’re done, see how they stack up in the next page.
